# /persistent

Put your persistent file (check [this guide](https://github.com/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev/wiki/FAQ#i-want-to-back-up-my-persistent)
if you don't know where is it located) in this folder.

**Important!** It is necessary that `persistent` file is located right here! Make sure your file tree looks like this:
```
ddlc-heroku/
├── ...
└── persistent/
    ├── ...
    └── persistent
```
