# /ddlc

Put your existing DDLC install contents here (this should include foldes and files such as `game` and `DDLC.exe`.)

**Important!** It is necessary that DDLC install contents are located right here! Make sure your file tree looks like this:
```
ddlc-heroku/
├── ...
└── ddlc/
    ├── ...
    ├── game/
    │   └── ...
    └── DDLC.exe
```
